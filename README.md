# Individual Project

This is code written in Python using a JupyterLab notebook that provides basic analysis of the iris dataset. The analysis includes K Nearest Neighbours and Principal Component Analysis to separate and identify three different species of iris based on their morphological features. Finally, the code includes space to input data into the model that can be used to predict the iris species the morphological data could have come from. Although this code uses the iris dataset, it can be edited to analyse other datasets in a similar way.

To run the code:

1. Download the JupyterLab notebook that holds the script which can be found in this repository. Click on the file then click "Raw", in the new tab that opens save the file with Ctrl + S. In JupyterLab, navigate to where you saved the file. It will open as a xxx.ipynb.txt, remove the .txt from the file name and reopen the file in JupyterLab, the file should now open as a notebook and the code can be run from there.

2. Code to read in the iris data, as well as code for importing modules needed for the analysis are all included within the script.

3. If using a different dataset, be sure to edit the DataFrame and feature names used in the code to match the new dataset being imported.

From the analysis, I found that sepal width and length are adequate morphological features that can be used to predict the species of iris and can discriminate between the three species fairly well.
